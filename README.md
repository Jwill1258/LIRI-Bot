# LIRI-Bot

| NODE | AXIOS | MOMENT |

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

For the sake of this example, the search options have been programmed to give feedback on songs, movies, and upcoming concerts. Simply type **"movie-this"**, **"concert-this"**, or **"spotify-this-song"** along with your corresponding chosen search topic in the random.txt file that links to the liri.js commands and watch the magic happen.

Please see the below example:
